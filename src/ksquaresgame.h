/**
 * @short The game controller
 *
 * Keeps charge of the game. Everything you'd expect really.
 * 
 * - Create one instance of this class which will last the whole time the program is running.
 * 
 * - In order to start a (new) game just call @ref createGame() with the appropriate arguments.
 * 
 * - Once the game is started, play passes to the first player. @ref takeTurnSig() will be emitted to allow you to chose how the go should be taken (AI controller or 'click' from a View).
 * 
 * - However the turn is taken, to make the move, the @ref addLineToIndex() function must be called. This will emit the @ref drawLine() signal to allow you to draw the line on the board with the correct colours.
 * 
 * - If the player completed a square, @ref drawSquare() will then be emitted to allow you to draw the completed square with the correct colour.
 * 
 * - If the player gets another go, @ref takeTurnSig() will be emitted again. If not, play will pass to the next player and @ref takeTurnSig() will be emitted for them.
 * 
 * - If a player completes the scoreboard, @ref gameOver() will be emitted with the full list of players to allow you to construct a score board.
 * 
 * - All variables will remain in the state they were at the end of the game until @ref createGame() is called again.
