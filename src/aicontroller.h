 * @short AI Controller for KSquares
 *
 * When playing a game of squares there are a number of stages the game goes through:
 * @li The random line placement stage. Where players are just placing lines while trying to not complete the third side of any squares
 * @li Next players will try to only draw the third side of a square if it will only give the opponent the minimum amount of points
 * @li The more advanced player will, at the end of a large run of squares leave a small area at the end, forcing the opponent to take only that small section, leaving another large area open to him.
 * @li The even more advanced player will fight for control over the game. This means that he will count the chains forming in the last phase of the "random line" game phase and thus make sure that he will be the one who gets the first long chain. This works like a Nim game somehow.
 * Currently, the first three points are implemented.
