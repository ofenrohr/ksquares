This is a modified version built from Dabble version 1.3. 
You can pass two command line parameters:

dabble[_nohash].exe [SAVEGAME [TIMEOUT]]

Where SAVEGAME must be a path to a dabble compatible file containing a game that
is not completed and TIMEOUT is the time in seconds for dabble to complete a 
single move. When there are command line arguments dabble will only show a
window for a very short time and exit after it calculated the next move. That
move is available in dabble.log in the current working directory.

This version of dabble has been compiled with Visual Studio 2013. To get dabble
running on your Linux system you need the correct DLLs. You can get those with

sh winetricks vcrun2013

If winetricks fails to install the DLLs with the following error message:
sha1sum mismatch!  Rename /home/USERNAME/.cache/winetricks/vcrun2013/vcredist_x86.exe and try again.
You have to edit winetricks on line 7344: run
sha1sum /home/USERNAME/.cache/winetricks/vcrun2013/vcredist_x86.exe
and replace the hash on line 7344 in winetricks.
The winetricks script in this directory worked on 23.02.2015 after modifing the
hash.

If you are using Arch-Linux install wine and cabextract, then execute 'sh winetricks vcrun2013'.
