This is a modified version built from Dabble version 1.3. 
You can pass two command line parameters:

dabble[_nohash].exe [SAVEGAME [TIMEOUT]]

Where SAVEGAME must be a path to a dabble compatible file containing a game that
is not completed and TIMEOUT is the time in seconds for dabble to complete a 
single move. When there are command line arguments dabble will only show a
window for a very short time and exit after it calculated the next move. That
move is available in dabble.log in the current working directory.
